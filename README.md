# Deep Reinforcment Learning case study : Unity Banana environment with DQN

### Set-up the environments

### Environment
Banana environement is a state of the art environmenent provided by Unity to train smart Agents. The goal for the single player is to navigate in the environment to collect yellow banana and avoid blue one. Each yellow banana collected return a postive feedback (a reward) that increase our final score.
The completes environment ( position of bananas, distance from bananas...) is not initially expicitely provided. So our smart agent have to guess from the observations that the environment return for each action carried out.
-> Picture of the environment.
Thus for an agent A that take an action each time step t at the environment provide some continous states St.
